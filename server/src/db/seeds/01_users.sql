  'Before I began my weight-loss journey, I lacked confidence, motivation, and self-esteem. I hid in my house to avoid being seen by anyone who had known me before I gained weight. My self-isolation and lack of confidence was starting to affect my marriage and friendships. At 26, I hit my heaviest weight of 200 pounds. I had reflected on the past year and realized that it had consisted of going to work, then immediately coming home to just sit in the house with my husband and kids. I decided that night that I had had enough. I was going to start working on making myself feel and look better. After researching and trying different workouts programs and exercises, I found that I loved how my body reacted to lifting and targeted body sculpting. There were times where I indulged for days and weeks at a time. However, I never lost sight of my goal and the reasons why I wanted to lose weight and get healthier.',
  'Avoid sugar if possible(e.g., soft drinks, fruit juices, ice cream among many others). Limit intake of pasta, cereal and bread. Be careful with cheese and nuts, as it''s easy to overeat on them. Don''t eat more than one piece of fruit per day',
  'To maintain discipline about my workout and diet. Do one outdoor workout per week. Try new group fitness class'

  'Hi! A bit about me, well for starters, I enjoy food. I''m not interested in blacklisting anything from my diet. I KNOW, sugar is the worst thing ever and alcohol is just empty calories. But cookies are delicious, and I enjoy a glass of wine or three occasionally. Or some quality tequila, neat, because if you have to dress it up or chase it, you shouldn''t be drinking it. I am unapologetically lazy. I''m at a point in life where I don''t care to spend 2+ hours in the gym. After about an hour, I''d better see daylight. Also, three days a week is good for me. I used to get after it four and five days a week. I just don''t care that much anymore; I''ve got other things to do with my time. While keeping in mind the first two points, I still want maximum-ish results. I''m not interested in working unnecessarily hard and giving up a lot; I''m interested in working efficiently. I want seemingly disproportionate results. Note that I didn''t say I won''t ever have to work hard, just that I''m going to be smart about it.', 
  'In terms of health tips, I don''t have a ton of advice to give. I guess that''s part of the reason I am here looking for inspiration from others. But what I will say, is, if you have a plan, stick with it! If you take a few days off here and there and you get loose about it, that''s not a plan. Dedicate yourself!', 
  'I''m looking to gain about 5-10 pounds of muscle this year. I''d like to duplicate that next year as well and then after that my goal is to lean out to work towards a more defined physique.'
