My digestion had been terrible for years and it was only getting worse. The worse it got, the more I craved that which I knew was bad for me. Finally, I hit my rock bottom. I got home early on a Monday evening while my teammate was still leading bible studies on campus. I didn''t buy sugar so I ate weird things to get my fix. That night my choice was frozen king cake.

  'Anyone who understands even a bit about fitness will know how difficult it is to gain muscles naturally. During the last 4 years, there came a point when I lost everything which I had built for years.
  I had met with a terrible accident which left me with broken bones. I had lost all sense of reality and when I gained consciousness, I had already lost 15 kilos. Hence, I had become really self-conscious. It was perhaps the lowest point of my life because it felt like the point of no return.',

Even when you''re underweight, be mindful of excess sugar and fat. An occasional slice of pie with ice cream is OK. But most treats should be healthy and provide nutrients in addition to calories. ',

  'Baking Like A Vegetarian',
  'I used to be a bakery trainer for a major supermarket chain, before I became a teacher. So I can bake anything, from Croissants to Danish to Cakes, and I also have a sweet tooth. So that was sort of hard. I asked myself "how do you make a dessert without all that added sugar, without all the added fat or the eggs, or the dairy"? Especially because the cornerstone of most pastry is eggs, as well as butter, and dairy. So it was tough to make that change. Probably the hardest thing to give up was the cheese. The meat wasn''t too hard, but you know, the cheese, which we used to put on everything. And then we had to figure out ways to get away from that taste addiction.',
  'For eggs and dairy, I don''t think of it as substituting eggs and dairy because they serve as a certain component. Whether its eggs for a binder or for a lift in a product or for adding fat. So, I look at things I can use instead, for fat, for binders, and for leavening. So for instance instead of fat, a lot of it now comes from using nuts.',
