  'Low Carb and Self-care',
  'My weight loss allowed me to understand that I am important, that it is okay to give myself permission to take care of me. Creating a routine to take care of myself is not being selfishâ€”it is self-care, and I need it. I have regained my confidence and discovered a new passion for fitness. However, the upsides do not come all at once. I found that you have to take the time to celebrate the little wins and changes. The goal is progress, not perfection.',
  'I began going to the gym first thing in the morning. I would be at the gym at 5:00 a.m., so I could start my day off with a workout and still be home in time to help get my three children ready for school. Also, prioritizing the beginning of my day to my workouts reduces the likelihood that I will find an excuse not to go to the gym.',

  'Feeding the sugar demon', 
  'My roommate would bake banana bread and eat one piece. I would finish it off. Dessert was on my mind all the time and I was always looking for a way to get something sweet into my day. There are so many moments from that first year of which I am ashamed. On a trip to Auburn, try as I did, I could not help but binge at the tailgate sweet table. My spirit was guilty and my body was sick. I have always been pretty thin and so no one would have ever suspected my internal battle. My digestion had been terrible for years and it was only getting worse. The worse it got, the more I craved that which I knew was bad for me. Finally, I hit my rock bottom. I got home early on a Monday evening while my teammate was still leading bible studies on campus. I didn''t buy sugar so I ate weird things to get my fix. That night my choice was frozen king cake. I took the cake from the freezer, ripped off the top with the icing, ate it and threw the rest away. I took a couple of sweets from my roommate''s drawer. Within about 5 minutes I probably consumed 1000 calories of sugar. Realizing what happened, I sat down and had my moment of truth. I''m eating in secret, I''m stealing, I''m ashamed, I can''t stop. I''m addicted. They so acknowledgement is the first step to healing so here''s to hoping.', 
  '4 days on 3 days off with 30 minutes of cardio 2x/week. Abdominals got a special focus this week with 5x2 minute intervals of planking each day. The rest of my workout was 3 different weight baring exercises, 4 sets x 10 reps for each. 1 minute rest between sets. I focused on a different body part each day.',
